# **Vector Addition**

Implement a program that performs element-wise addition of two vectors containing 32-bit floating point numbers on a GPU. The program should take two input vectors of equal length and produce a single output vector containing their sum.

## **Implementation Requirements**

- External libraries are not permitted
- The ``solve`` function signature must remain unchanged
- The final result must be stored in vector ``C``

## **Example 1:**

```
Input:  A = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
        B = [5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
Output: C = [6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0]
```

## **Example 2:**

```
Input:  A = [1.5, 1.5, 1.5]
        B = [2.3, 2.3, 2.3]
Output: C = [3.8, 3.8, 3.8]
```

## **Constraints**

- Input vectors ``A`` and ``B`` have identical lengths
- 1 ≤ ``N`` ≤ 100,000,000
